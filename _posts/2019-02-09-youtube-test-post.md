Hey legacy traders it's Tim with Option Legacy helping you build a legacy

through trading. Guys I've got a big smile on my face because we're breaking down for you today our case study in our Apple trade that produced a 95.7% return on investment in just three days just three days. So let's go look at it. First off, let me show you the proof of in the pudding proof in the pudding here it is this is Apple we entered into this trade back here on January 31st and we exited out today. Today is February 1st so this was I believe Friday and so 3 days here we entered in a one contract February fifteenth expiration and it was a 167.50 call we bought to open it costs us $3.50 and then today we exit out this morning we sold this thing for $6.65. We made uh six eighty five minus

three fifty three hundred thirty five

bucks

ninety five point seven percent return

on investment so guys if you're

interested in following along trades

like this I'm gonna break down the chart

here in a moment but if you're

interested in following along trades

like this go over to option legacy com

forward slash Susie alerts

that's our alert trade alert

subscription service where you literally

get access to every trade that we enter

every trade that we exit and the

rationale behind it as soon as it

happens and this trade alert was sent

out to all our Susie trade alert

subscribers so go to option legacy com

forward slash Susie alerts and let's

look at the chart on why we entered this

thing so we have to first look at Apple

and recognize that it has been well

let's see if I can move my self over

into the next corner

boom there we go okay um you can see

from the chart that it's been in a

downward trend as has most of technology

or most tech sector and then we had back

here did you do where is it right about

here on maybe one eighteen

or 1:22 we had the 10 day simple moving

average cross above the 20 day

so let me break that down for you a

little bit on the chart the 10 day

simple moving average is the blue line

the 20 is the green line the 50 is the

orange line but whenever you have a

smaller time period like a 10 day

crossing a bigger time period like the

20-day to whatever direction it could be

an indication of momentum to that

direction so back on the 18th or the

22nd of January we had the 10 day

crossed above the 20 and then we had the

price-point

cross above the 50-day simple moving

average that blue line and that's what

triggered us to say hey this can be an

entry so we had momentum coming up with

the moving averages moving higher the

price point moving higher we had

earnings back here on the 29th and that

caused the price point to move above

that 15 a simple moving average and

closed higher than it so we then set an

alert saying that if the price point

continues higher the next day we're

gonna enter into a bullish trade here to

make money as this thing moves to the

upside and guess what day that is that's

the 31st and it did move higher we

entered in actually kind of at the top

of the market kind of towards the height

of that wick and then the next day it

just moves sideways as far as price

point goes and we actually took a

drawdown of about 30% maybe 35% of this

position was a loss by February 1st

but our exit point would be and talked

about this with our Suzy trailer

subscribers would be that if it closed

beneath the wick of the previous day so

the low of this day if the price point

closed beneath the low of the previous

day then we would exit or if it closes

beneath the 50-day simple moving average

we would exit and that did not happen so

we held into it and then over the

weekend

February 4th Monday comes we have a two

and a half percent move to the upside

and then today we have another one

almost two percent moved to the upside

we went ahead and took profits again

guys this was a ninety five point seven

percent return on investment in three

trading days we took profits we took

three hundred fifty bucks per contract

and grew it into six hundred and eighty

five dollars per contract in three days

in three days and this is with our Suzy

trade alert subscription so we talked

about taking profits if the price point

closed beneath the low of the previous

day and you say Tim you accident and

that didn't happen you're right because

I hit my profit target which was one

hundred percent return on investment or

ninety six percent return on investment

that was good enough for me to say take

my wins and keep on going so think about

it if your position size was let's say

five hundred bucks or maybe a thousand

bucks or five thousand bucks

you would have doubled that in three

days with this one trade so that is and

every trade alert subscriber got access

to it as soon as it happened so if
