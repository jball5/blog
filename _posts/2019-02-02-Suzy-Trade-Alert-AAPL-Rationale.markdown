Let's go look inside the chart and break down the rationale. So since the end of October, we've been in a downward trend in apple and then back on January 18th, you can see this blue line on the chart is a 10 day simple moving average and it crossed above the Green Line, which is the 20 days simple moving average showing that there's movement or momentum to the upside. This shows a possible trend reversal.<!--more-->

Since, on January 18th, the 10 SMA crossed above the 20 SMA we would need the next following day to move up for us to signal entry into a bullish trade. But what happened? It didn't move up, it moved down, and then it continued to move sideways. Then we had some positive price movement to the upside on January 25th, but it didn't close above the high of January 18th to signal entry.

So we have been waiting for a close above the high of January 18th's price. Then we had earnings announcement and it popped for us. It popped and it popped beautifully. So it's sitting right above that orange, 50 SMA average line.

It closed above January 18th's price yesterday on Thursday, January 30th so we entered in a long Call. We were waiting to see momentum to the upside and seeing a possible trend reversal. Then we had confirmation with today's (January 31st) continued move to the upside, even though it retreated a bit and threw a Doji.

So now let's talk about where we're going to exit. We're going to continue to ride this thing as it moves up, as long as it's moving up. We will exit when the price point closes below the low of the previous day's candle body. So, for example, today, once we entered in, we would need it to close beneath January 30th's 163.23 low and then on Friday we would exit if it continued down. This is called patience. Waiting for confirmation to trigger us in or out.

The only point that we would exit this is if it closes beneath the low of the previous day Candle body. So as soon as that happens we would then analyze the next day for confirmation then we would exit. As long as it continues to move up, we will stay in it.

We have alerts if AAPL drops below:

January 31st's low of $164.56
January 30th's open price/50 SMA of $163.25

We will adjust up these alerts every trading day to the previous day's close price. If the alert triggers this will alert us to come and look to possibly exit the trade.

So that's the rationale behind the apple trade alert. If you have any questions, let me know and then also give me some feedback.
