For most, trading solo is not out of the ordinary. When I first started trading, I felt stranded on an island like Tom Hanks in Cast Away.

I didn’t have anyone to talk to about investing and my wife would look at me in bewilderment if I explained any investing strategy. I kept on searching and searching for a like-minded trader until I found one, Tim Key. I think both of us were equally as excited and desperate to find each other. I found that investing is one thing, but investing in stock options is another.

  
Finding a trader you can talk to about stock market derivatives and risk without the cautionary “options are too risky” comment is hard to come by. I’ve been down that road. Luckily, you have found the right place. Here at {INSERT NAME HERE} we primarily invest by trading stock options and use real money in real portfolios. Thats right! You don’t have to trade alone. I am a firm believer in the power of success by trading with like-minded individuals, and by trading together we can see our dreams realized. You can reach out to us via social media, or contact us via email. More than getting to know us and discover how we trade, we would love to grow with you and learn together. If you’re looking for the next great stock picker, you won’t find it here or anywhere else. Real wealth creation is not a get rich quick scheme. I believe financial dreams are realized by trading for a long period of time, in all types of markets, and putting in the work.

Trading doesn’t have to be alone. Trading and surviving this market is done best in community with a group of like minded individuals all going after our financial goals.
